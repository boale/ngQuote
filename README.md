Angular-based Quote generator with all necessary CI/CD configurations and integrations. 

Also it has basic integrations with Ngrx or Ngxs stores (see `feature/ngrxStore` or `feature/ngxsStore` respectively). 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
Use the `--prod` flag for a production build or `npm run build:prod` command.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
